## Deployment History
1. **Latest Successful**: ID eac21a4f-f538-4959-993c-4fc6404cfc08 (Oct 13, 2025 05:07 UTC)
   - Status: SUCCESS
   - Running the previous stable version

2. **Recent Failed**: ID 90bacd04-21f8-46a9-b095-9f371394c08e (Oct 13, 2025 05:50 UTC)
   - Status: FAILED
   - Issue: Build failure (likely due to missing dependencies or build configuration)

## Current Status
The production deployment is **accessible and running**, but it's showing the **previous version** (TanStack starter template) rather than the new UI/UX improvements. The latest deployment with UI changes failed during the build process.

## Recommended Actions
1. **Build Issue Investigation**: The latest deployment failed during build. This may be due to:
   - Missing environment variables during build time
   - Dependency installation issues
   - Build script configuration

2. **Manual Deployment**: To deploy the new UI changes, you may need to:
   - Access Railway dashboard at https://railway.app
   - Check build logs for the failed deployment
   - Manually trigger a new deployment after fixing any issues

3. **Alternative**: The application works perfectly in local development with all UI improvements. You can continue development locally while investigating the Railway deployment issue.

- **Production URL**: https://quidditch-video-analysis-production.up.railway.app
