# Vertex AI vs Google AI (genai) API Comparison

## Quick Summary

Both APIs can analyze YouTube videos with nearly identical code thanks to the new unified SDK (google-genai). The main differences are in authentication, pricing, and enterprise features.

## Implementation Comparison

### Current Implementation (Google AI / genai)
```python
from google import genai

# Simple API key authentication
client = genai.Client(api_key="your-api-key")

# Analyze YouTube video
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="models/gemini-2.0-flash",
    contents=types.Content(parts=[
        types.Part(file_data=types.FileData(file_uri=youtube_url)),
        types.Part(text=prompt)
    ])
)
```

### Vertex AI Implementation
```python
from google import genai
import os

# Requires Google Cloud setup
os.environ["GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT"] = "your-project-id"

# Create Vertex AI client
client = genai.Client(
    vertexai=True,
    project="your-project-id",
    location="us-central1"  # or your preferred region
)

# Same code for video analysis!
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",  # Note: no "models/" prefix for Vertex
    contents=types.Content(parts=[
        types.Part(file_data=types.FileData(file_uri=youtube_url)),
        types.Part(text=prompt)
    ])
)
```

## Pros and Cons

### Google AI (genai) - Current Implementation

**✅ Pros:**
- **Free tier**: Generous free usage (15 RPM, 1M requests/day)
- **Simple setup**: Just need an API key
- **Quick prototyping**: Perfect for development and testing
- **No billing setup**: Start immediately without credit card
- **Identical features**: Same video analysis capabilities as Vertex AI

**❌ Cons:**
- **Rate limits**: Lower rate limits even in paid tier
- **No enterprise features**: No SLAs, private endpoints, or IAM controls
- **Data usage**: In free tier, Google may use your data to improve products
- **Regional limitations**: Limited regional deployment options

### Vertex AI

**✅ Pros:**
- **Enterprise ready**: SLAs, compliance certifications, audit logs
- **IAM integration**: Fine-grained access control with Google Cloud IAM
- **Volume discounts**: 20-40% discounts at high volumes
- **Private endpoints**: VPC Service Controls for secure access
- **Regional deployment**: Deploy in specific regions for compliance
- **Dynamic quotas**: Auto-scaling capacity without quota management
- **Billing integration**: Consolidated with other Google Cloud services

**❌ Cons:**
- **Complex setup**: Requires Google Cloud project, billing, and configuration
- **No free tier**: Pay-as-you-go from the start ($400 credit for new users)
- **Overhead**: Overkill for personal projects or prototypes
- **Learning curve**: Need to understand Google Cloud concepts

## Pricing Comparison

### For Your Use Case (Video Analysis)

Both use identical token pricing:
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: ~$0.075 per million input tokens
- **Video processing**: ~300 tokens per second of video
- **45-minute video**: ~810,000 tokens ≈ $0.06 per analysis

**Key Difference**: Google AI has a generous free tier, Vertex AI doesn't.

## Feature Parity

Both support:
- ✅ YouTube video analysis (public videos)
- ✅ 1 FPS frame sampling
- ✅ Same models (Gemini 2.0, 2.5)
- ✅ Same token limits and context windows
- ✅ Same timestamp accuracy (±2-3 seconds)

## VideoMetadata Chunking Support ⚠️

**Important Discovery**: Both APIs theoretically support VideoMetadata for video chunking, BUT:

### Current Status (as of 2024)
- **Google AI (genai)**: VideoMetadata causes validation errors ❌
- **Vertex AI**: VideoMetadata is documented and *might* work ⚠️

The documentation shows it should work:
```python
# Theoretical implementation (may not work in practice)
types.Part(
    file_data=types.FileData(file_uri=youtube_url),
    video_metadata=types.VideoMetadata(
        start_offset="180s",   # Start at 3 minutes
        end_offset="360s"      # End at 6 minutes
    )
)
```

### Known Issues
- GitHub issue #854 reports 500 errors with VideoMetadata
- Multiple forum posts about non-working video chunking
- The feature appears to be documented but not fully implemented

### If Chunking Works in Vertex AI
This would be a **major advantage** for Vertex AI:
- Process long videos in parallel segments
- Reduce per-request token usage
- Get more detailed analysis of specific portions
- Potential 5-10x speed improvement for long videos

### Testing Required
The `analyze_video_vertex_chunked.py` script can test if VideoMetadata actually works in Vertex AI. If it does, this alone might justify using Vertex AI for long video analysis.

## Recommendations

### Stay with Google AI (genai) if:
- You're building a personal project or prototype ✅
- You want free usage for development ✅
- You don't need enterprise features ✅
- You prefer simple API key authentication ✅
- Your current needs are met ✅

### Switch to Vertex AI if:
- You need SLAs for production
- You require compliance certifications (HIPAA, SOC, etc.)
- You want IAM-based access control
- You're already using Google Cloud services
- You need private endpoints or VPC controls
- You expect high volume (>100M tokens) for discounts

## Migration Path

The beauty of the new unified SDK is you can start with Google AI and migrate later:

1. **Develop with Google AI** (free, simple)
2. **Test and refine** your application
3. **When ready for production**, just change the client initialization:
   ```python
   # From this:
   client = genai.Client(api_key="key")

   # To this:
   client = genai.Client(vertexai=True, project="id", location="region")
   ```
4. **No code changes** needed for the actual video analysis!

## Bottom Line

For your quidditch video analysis project, **stick with Google AI (genai)** UNLESS:

### The ONE reason to try Vertex AI
**If VideoMetadata chunking actually works in Vertex AI** (unconfirmed), it would provide:
- 10x faster processing for long videos
- Parallel segment analysis
- More detailed results per segment

To test this, you'd need a Google Cloud account (free $300 credit for new users).

### Otherwise, stay with Google AI
- Free tier is generous
- Simpler setup (just API key)
- Same features (except possibly chunking)
- Easy migration path if needed later

The new unified SDK means you can easily switch between them without rewriting your code!

## Setup Status

✅ **Google Cloud CLI installed** at `/Users/austin/google-cloud-sdk/`

To complete Vertex AI setup:
1. Run: `gcloud auth application-default login`
2. Create/select a Google Cloud project
3. Enable Vertex AI API
4. Test with `analyze_video_vertex_chunked.py`

See `VERTEX_AI_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.
